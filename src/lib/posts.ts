The Hypothesis Engine delivers: a structured, AI-powered methodology that transforms raw literature into actionable scientific hypotheses.\n\nWhat if you loaded research articles into an LLM chat and let the AI infer across them? It holds all details - methods, results, nuances - in memory, spotting human-missed connections and hypotheses. And the best part: modern AI chats do this out of the box, fetching via APIs, stripping fluff, processing automatically. Just ask the right way.\n\nA simple yet powerful idea: leverage LLMs to synthesize novel hypotheses by combining insights from the latest research papers, fetched programmatically via APIs (e.g., arXiv, PubMed).\n\nAt its heart, the engine harnesses massive LLM context windows. We distill papers to their core signal - hypothesis, methods, results - slashing token costs by up to 75%. Hundreds of these summaries fill 70-80% of the window, preserving a cognitive buffer for reasoning. Targeted prompts then trigger synthesis: conflicts surface, gaps appear, and fresh hypotheses emerge from idea cross-pollination.\n\nThis article unpacks the process step-by-step. Each section blends formal rigor with ELI5 analogies, backed by token math and capacity examples.\n\n## The Infrastructure: Context Windows and Tokens\n\n![Carpenter's workbench tools illustration for context windows and tokens](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624905917904-4afb5105b5ae?w=800&h=400&fit=crop)\n\nTo understand how an AI processes research, one must first understand\nthe boundaries of its memory.\n\nThe **Context Window** represents the finite span of active memory available to a Large Language Model (LLM) during a specific inference session. It is the cumulative limit of input data (what you provide) and output generation (what the model writes). This space is measured not in words, but in **Tokens**. A token is the fundamental unit of semantic processing - typically a fragment of a word, a single character, or a whole word, depending on complexity.\n\n> Imagine a carpenter's workbench.\n>\n> The Context Window is the size of the table. You can only work on projects that fit on the table. If you pile too much stuff on it, things fall off the edge and are forgotten.\n>\n> Tokens are the tools and wood blocks on that table. A simple hammer is one token; a complex power tool might be three tokens. The goal is to fit as many useful tools on the table as possible without running out of space to work.\n\n## The Methodology: Populating and Researching\n\n![Dinner party illustration for methodology](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1414235077428-338989a2e8c0?w=800&h=400&fit=crop)\n\nThe goal is not merely to store articles but to interrogate them.\n\nTo populate the context window effectively, we ingest scientific literature through a process of **semantic aggregation**. We do not treat the window as a passive archive; rather, it serves as an active reasoning engine. By loading the window with diverse datasets (articles), we enable the model to perform **cross-document inference** - identifying non-obvious relationships, contradictions, or synergies between papers that were written years apart or in different fields.\n\n\n> Think of this like hosting a dinner party for 100 scientists.\n>\n> **Populating**: We invite the scientists (the articles) into the room (the context window).\n>\n> **Researching**: Instead of letting them stand alone, we force them to talk to each other. We ask, \"Hey, Dr. Biology, does your theory fit with what Dr. Physics just said?\" By listening to their conversation, we come up with new ideas that neither scientist could have found alone.\n\n## The Mechanism: Extraction and Distillation\n\n![Juicer illustration for mechanism](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564415900645-30612d54dd0c?w=800&h=400&fit=crop)\n\nThe raw text of a scientific paper contains significant redundancy. To maximize the efficiency of the context window, we apply **Data Distillation**.\n\nScientific manuscripts follow a rigid structure containing both **Signal** (novel data, methodologies, statistical outcomes) and **Noise** (standard boilerplate, broad literature reviews, administrative metadata).\n\n**The Process**: We parse the document to isolate the Signal. We extract the core hypothesis, the specific methodology, the quantitative results (p-values, sample sizes), and the conclusion.\n\n**The Rationale**: This increases the **Information Density**. By stripping away the \"fluff,\" we reduce the token cost of an article by up to 75% without losing any scientific fidelity.\n\n\n> Imagine you want to make orange juice.\n>\n> **The Article** is the whole orange—peel, seeds, and pulp.\n>\n> **Distillation** is the juicer. We squeeze the orange to get the juice (the facts/data) and throw away the peel (the fancy intros and \"thank yous\").\n>\n> **The Result**: A glass of pure juice takes up much less space than a bag of oranges, but it tastes just as strong.\n\n## The Mathematics: Token Calculation and Capacity\n\n![Calculator illustration for token calculation](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1609155035300-15e1ffa95f12?w=800&h=400&fit=crop)\n\nLet us quantify the efficiency of this approach.\n\n**The Token Exchange Rate**: On average, 1,000 English words equate to approximately 1,300 tokens. Conversely, 1,000 tokens represent about 750 words.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nConsider a standard medical article of 6,000 words.\n\n**Raw Cost**: 6,000 words ≈ 8,000 tokens.\n\n**Distilled Cost**: After extracting only the abstract, methods, and key results, we reduce this to ~800 words. 800 words ≈ 1,066 tokens.\n\n### Capacity Analysis (Based on a 1 Million Token Window)\n\n**Raw Approach**: 1,000,000 capacity / 8,000 tokens/paper = 125 articles\n\n**Distilled Approach**: 1,000,000 capacity / 1,066 tokens/paper ≈ 938 articles\n\n**Result**: Distillation allows us to analyze nearly 1,000 papers simultaneously.\n\n\n## The Strategy: Cognitive Buffer and Derived Knowledge\n\n![Backpack illustration for cognitive buffer](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553062407-98eeb64c6a62?w=800&h=400&fit=crop)\n\nWe must never fill the window to 100% capacity with data.\n\nWe reserve approximately 20% to 30% of the context window as a **Cognitive Buffer**. This space is required for the model to process the information, generate complex reasoning chains, and formulate the output. If the window is entirely full of text, the model has no \"scratchpad\" left to perform the analysis.\n\n**Potential Derived Knowledge**:\nWith a window populated by 50–100 distilled articles and a healthy buffer, we can achieve:\n- **Conflict Detection**: \"Paper A (2024) claims X, but Paper B (2025) disproves this using Method Y.\"\n- **Gap Analysis**: \"None of the 50 papers address the side effects of this drug on geriatric patients.\"\n- **Hypothesis Generation**: \"Combining the material from Paper 12 with the surgical technique in Paper 45 could reduce healing time by half.\"\n\n> You have a backpack (Context Window) for a school trip.\n>\n> You pack 900 books (Distilled Articles).\n>\n> **Crucial Step**: You must leave space for your notebook and pen (The Buffer).\n>\n> If you pack the bag so full that you can't fit your notebook, you can read the books, but you can't write down any answers. We leave space so we can write the report that connects all the stories together.\n\n\n## Similar Ideas in the Wild\n\nOthers are exploring this space:\n\nSakana AI's \"The AI Scientist\" autonomously generates hypotheses, codes, and papers [sakana.ai](https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist-first-publication).\n\nEthan Mollick's \"Co-Intelligence\" uses AI to uncover blind spots [stanford](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/co-intelligence-ai-masterclass-ethan-mollick).\n\n\"Serendipity Engineering\" blogs on AI connecting dots [medium](https://medium.com/@snappystrategist/curiosity-and-serendipity-our-edge-in-the-age-of-ai-83c3c8d1b45b).\n\n\n## Example Prompt\n\nHere's a simple prompt I tested in Gemini:\n\n```\nFrom PubMed, get 10 recent articles on wound healing. Synthesize new ideas and hypotheses from their intersections.\n```\n\nI ran phases sequentially. Gemini auto-distilled articles, but it's not deterministic. Try manually, sequentially, or tweak—experiment to find your style!\n",
